Wrestling RPG
=============

Stats:
------
Toughness - Health
Stamina - Recovery Power
Strength - Attack Potential
Counter - Defense Potential

Starting:
You have 10d6 to distribute (splitting of die is allowed - equal to 3.5 pips)
No stat can go above 4d6. No stat can be less than 0.5 pips

Your Toughness = #(toughness dice) * 6

Moveset:
--------
Moves fall in 4 categories: Punch, Kick, Leap, Grapple
Each move has 3 stats: Speed, Damage, Degree
(Speed and Damage are decided by you, while Degree is not)

Constraints:
* For each move, Speed + Damage should be equal to 5 + 10 * Degree
* Degree starts at 1, and may change during the battle.

HP and Status changes:
----------------------
Statuses: Fresh, Tired, Exhausted, Zombie

Initial HP = 4 * Toughness

If current HP > 3 * Toughness, Fresh
If current HP > 2 * Toughness, Tired
If current HP > 1 * Toughness, Exhausted
If current HP > 0, Zombie
If current HP = 0, You Lose!

Audience:
---------
The charisma die (1d6 + momentum?) will roll at the end of every combat turn for each player. On a roll = 5-6, the audience gets pumped, and wants to see more action from that player. The degree of the player increases as per the following chart:

If Fresh,       1d6 > 0 (always)
If Tired,       1d6 > 2 (3,4,5,6)
If Exhausted,   1d6 > 4 (5,6)
If Zombie,      1d6 > 6 (never)

On a roll = 1, the audience gets bored, and wants to see more drama from that player. The degree of the player reduces by 1 or 2 (by die roll).

If the HP difference between players is greater than 6 * (#toughness dice + #stamina dice), the weaker player becomes the 'underdog'. His degree increases to MAX.

Battle:
-------

0) Players choose their moves. Inform GM without showing the other player(s). Players tell GM by providing the move type, move speed, and move damage. GM releases move order.

1) Move with higher Speed goes first

2) Move has (Strength + Speed + Matching) power. If this power > (Counter + Enemy's Speed), the move hits, else the move fails. (If equal, higher speed wins)

3) Matching is based on category of moves:
... > Leap > Punch > Kick > Grapple > Leap > Punch > ...
+3 if Punch vs. Kick
+3 if Kick vs. Grapple
+3 if Grapple vs. Leap
+3 if Leap vs. Punch
-3 if Kick vs. Punch
-3 if Punch vs. Leap
-3 if Leap vs. Grapple
-3 if Grapple vs. Kick
0 otherwise

4) If the move hits, it does (Damage + Strength) damage, and HP of the opponent reduces.

5) Each player rolls the stamina dice and adds the total to their HP.

6) The Audience makes a decision (i.e. the charisma die rolls, and the degrees of the players may change)

Tag Team Matches:
----------------

If you wish to tag your teammate in, you roll a die:

If Fresh,       1d6 > 0 (always)
If Tired,       1d6 > 2 (3,4,5,6)
If Exhausted,   1d6 > 4 (5,6)
If Zombie,      1d6 > 6 (never)

The new incoming player will get a speed cut of 3*degree in his/her first attack.
